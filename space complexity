Q.how to figure out space complexity of algorithms about DSA problems in leetcode?

Determining the space complexity of algorithms in data structures and algorithms (DS&A) problems on LeetCode involves analyzing how much additional memory the algorithm uses as the input size grows. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you figure it out:

1. Understand Space Complexity
Space complexity includes:
  1. Auxiliary Space: Temporary memory used by the algorithm, such as variables, recursion stack, or data structures.
  2. Input Space: Memory taken by the input itself. Usually not considered unless copying or modifying the input.
  
2. Steps to Calculate Space Complexity
  a. Identify Variable Usage
    Look at how many variables you are using. Primitive data types like int, float, or char take constant space (O(1)).
  b. Check for Data Structures
    If you use additional data structures like arrays, lists, dictionaries, stacks, queues, or heaps, evaluate their size relative to the input. For example:
      - List/Array with n elements → O(n)
      - Hash Map/Dictionary with n elements → O(n)
      - Stack/Queue → Depends on the size of the problem, often O(n).
  c. Consider Recursive Calls
    Recursive algorithms use stack space for each function call.
    If there are n recursive calls, and each call uses constant space, the space complexity is O(n).
      Example: Recursive DFS in a graph with n nodes → O(n) space due to recursion stack.
  d. Account for Temporary Variables
    Temporary structures like visited arrays or any data structures initialized during the algorithm contribute to space complexity.
  e. Check for Modifications to Input
    If input arrays/lists are modified or sliced, those operations may incur additional memory.
    Example: Slicing a list in Python creates a new list → O(k), where k is the slice length.
  f. Big-O Notation
    Express the space complexity using Big-O notation, considering only the dominant term.
    
3. Example Problems
  Example 1: Two Sum 
    Algorithm:
      Store elements in a hash map while iterating through the array.
    Space complexity:
      Input array → O(n) (not counted in auxiliary space)
      Hash map → O(n)
      Overall → O(n)
  Example 2: Merge Two Sorted Lists (LeetCode 21)
    Algorithm:
      Merge two linked lists iteratively or recursively.
    Space complexity:
      Iterative: O(1) (no extra memory except a few pointers)
      Recursive: O(n + m) (stack space for recursion)
  Example 3: Depth-First Search (DFS) on a Graph
    Algorithm:
      Use recursion or an explicit stack.
    Space complexity:
      Recursion stack: O(V), where V is the number of vertices.
      Visited array: O(V)
      Adjacency list: O(V + E)
      Overall: O(V + E)

4. Tips to Master Space Complexity
  Trace Memory Usage: Walk through your code line by line to identify temporary variables and data structures.
  Analyze Recursion: If using recursion, count the maximum depth of recursive calls.
  Optimize: Reduce space usage by reusing variables or using in-place techniques.
  Practice: Solve problems with explicit space requirements, e.g., in-place sorting.

5. Practice Problems
  Easy: Two Sum, Reverse Linked List
  Medium: Daily Temperatures, Min Stack
  Hard: Trapping Rain Water, Merge K Sorted Lists

By analyzing the algorithm's logic and keeping the above points in mind, you’ll build the intuition to evaluate space complexity quickly.
